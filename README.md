### Hello! Welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ˜„ðŸ”­

My name is Jennifer. I've been working with IT for over 12 years. 
Over the years, I've developed a solid foundation in software testing, now applying that knowledge to build efficient and scalable solutions in Java, Spring, and microservices architecture.

Self-taught, curious, passionate about technology and challenges.
Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any collaboration opportunities or want to discuss Java, Spring or microservices.

Happy coding!ðŸš€
